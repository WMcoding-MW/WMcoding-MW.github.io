                    <p> Algebra, which I'm sure we're all aware of, is infact quite a large field of mathematics. A sub field of that
                        known as abstract algebra, studies algebraic structures, which include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces,
                        lattices and algebras. The following nodes connecting to this one, will cover abstract algebra 1, pre-req would be
                        basic discrete math terminology, which can be found connecting to this node. The next node will cover our first topic.
                        This first topic is known as binary operations, then we'll move into intro to groups. Please bare in mind, this is my first
                        abstract algebra class, so there may be errors or mistakes. If there is some, please email me so I can correct  them as soon as
                        possible. Thank you and I hope this helps you learn!
