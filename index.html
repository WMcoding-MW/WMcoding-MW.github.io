                <p>Throughout my university career, I have gained skills for the following languages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>ASM</li>
                    <li>MATLAB</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript/Node.js</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>STATA</li>
                    <li>R</li>
                </ul>  
                <p>From these skills, I'm able to pick up on almost any framework and language relatively quickly, given my math background problem solving is almost second nature.</p>

            <div class="info">
                <p>I've worked on many projects over the years, I have been programming for a total of 7 years now. From all these projects, whether big or small, it's not always about the end
            goal but the learning processes and struggles to get there. Although I have a few of my recent projects on my GitHub, I have 100+ more projects that aren't featured. 
            On the canvas below, I have recreated the mandlebrot visualization from my GitHub, from c++ to JavaScript. I decided to do this one because it's a fun little math project and it
            also produces a very nice image visually as well.  
                </p>

              <h2>
                  The mandlebrot set can be described simply as a set of c complex vales that orbit z = 0,
                  following the quadratic map of Z<sub>n+1</sub>&#178; = Z<sub>n</sub>+c; Where Z = x + iy. and Z<sub>n+1</sub>
                  remains bounded. therefore we can say c is a member of the mandlebrot set, when we start with Z&#8320; = 0. Although this is just a visualization,
                  the code can be found on my github for this whole website, as well as my other displayed projects. Clicking the button below will take you there. 
                  Also make sure to check out my blog! You can access it from the navbar on the left.
